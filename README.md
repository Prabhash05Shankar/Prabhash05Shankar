# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prabhash Shankar!

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a Kotlin-fueled Android Developer ☕📱 by day, Flutter explorer by night, and somewhere in between — a tech writer, startup dreamer, and spiritual soul.

---

## 🚀 Who am I?

- 🧠 MCA graduate with a mind full of code and curiosity.
- 💼 Currently working full-time as an Android Developer at **Ubuy**.
- 🧪 Previously interned as an Android dev — now turned pro!
- 🛠️ Fluent in **Java**, **Kotlin**, **XML**, and getting cozy with **Flutter + Dart**.
- ✍️ Writing articles to help fellow devs — because sharing is caring (and maybe earning too 🤞).

## 🔧 Tools & Tricks I Use

- Android Studio like it's my second home 🛋️
- Firebase? Check. Retrofit? Yup. Room DB? Already rented.
- Scroll pickers so slick even iOS users get jealous 😎
- Custom UI/UX because aesthetics matter.
- And yes, I do dark mode. Always. ☯️

---

## 🧪 Current Experiments

- Turning complex features into scrollable, beautiful, intuitive designs.
- Writing developer articles that are actually *fun* to read (not textbook-y).
- Exploring AI/ML one algorithm (and headache 😅) at a time.
- Trying to not kill my Betta fish. Still alive, btw 🐟.

## 🧘 Fun Facts

- I like my code clean and my spiritual path cleaner.
- I believe pickers should scroll and dev tools should *just work*.
- I run on Dry Awla and caffeine ☕ + 🍇
- One day, I’ll build an app that talks back to me — wait, already doing that 🤖
